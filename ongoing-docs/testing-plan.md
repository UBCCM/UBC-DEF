# Testing Plan

The CLF templates and documentation should be reviewed and tested to ensure compatibility with the project’s guiding principles, and maximum usability by engaging the user groups as identified in the user stories.

The types of testing that are possible/recommended:

* Usability testing
* Accessibility testing
* Stakeholder consultation & testing

## Usability testing

### Scope 

* What are the questions, usability concerns, and goals for the testing? 
* What tasks do we want people to complete?

### Participants

The number of participants can range from 5 \(minimum for getting insights to guide the design\) – 20 \(quantitative study aiming for statistical significance\).

Engage a select group of users representative of UBC’s key audiences:

* Prospective students
* Current students
* Faculty

### Methodology 

There are multiple options depending on the goals for the test and the tasks involved:

* Task-based in-person usability interviews with specific questions depending on the participant’s audience group \(a set of questions for prospective students vs faculty\)

* First-click tests

### Metrics & reporting 

Custom, depending on the type of test.
